```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### Warm up

```{r}
cleaned_penguins_1 <- penguins %>% 
  filter(island %in% c("Biscoe", "Dream")) %>% 
  select(species:body_mass_g) %>% 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) %>% 
  rename(location = island)

cleaned_penguins_2 <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  drop_na(flipper_length_mm) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
            sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm),
            sample_size = n())

cleaned_penguins_2
```

## Joins practice

```{r}
animals <- tibble::tribble(
  ~location,   ~species,  ~maturity,
   "lagoon",   "bobcat",    "adult",
    "bluff",   "coyote", "juvenile",
    "creek",      "fox",    "adult",
     "oaks", "squirrel", "juvenile",
    "bluff",   "bobcat",    "adult"
  )

sites <- tibble::tribble(
  ~location,      ~full_site_name, ~jurisdiction,
    "beach",       "Goleta Beach",     "SB City",
   "lagoon",        "UCSB Lagoon",        "UCSB",
    "bluff",       "Ellwood Mesa",     "SB City",
     "oaks", "Fremont Campground",        "USFS"
  )

```

### Full join

```{r}
animals_full_join <- full_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Left Join

left_join(animals, sites)

```{r}
animals_left_join <- left_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Inner join

```{r}
animals_inner_join <- inner_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

## Filtering joins

```{r}
animals_semi_join <- semi_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### anti-join

```{r}
animals_anti_join <- anti_join(animals, sites, by = "location")

sites_anti_join <- anti_join(sites, animals, by = "location")

# An example of joining multiple data sets with piping
join_pipe <- animals %>% 
  full_join(sites) %>% 
  inner_join(animals_anti_join)
```
